# Introduction to Pyra.run

Welcome to Pyra.run! This is your gateway to modern Next.js deployments on your own server.

## What is Pyra.run?

Pyra.run is a **powerful**, **efficient**, and **cost-effective** deployment solution that brings the simplicity of platform-as-a-service to your own virtual private server (VPS). With Pyra.run, you can:

- Use your **own VPS** without the need for expensive PaaS solutions

## Key Features

- **Simple Install**: Just add one workflow file to your repo and one line to your `next.config.js`.
- **Environment Variable Driven**: Configure your entire deployment through Github Secrets.
- **HTTPS Out of the Box**: Automatic SSL certificate provisioning and renewal.
- **Instant Rollbacks**: Re-run a Github Action to redeploy at any previous commit.
